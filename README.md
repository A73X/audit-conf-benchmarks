# audit-conf-benchmarks

**audit-conf-benchmarks** is a command-line tool and framework designed to help audit system configurations against security benchmarks, such as CIS Benchmarks.

It allows you to **parse machine configuration extracts**, **compare them against a specified benchmark (PDF or XLSX)**, and output compliance results in XLSX format. The project is built with extensibility in mind‚Äînew parsers and converters can be easily added to support different input formats and extraction tools.

‚öñÔ∏è **Legal Notice:** Per Center for Internet Security (CIS) terms, CIS Benchmarks in PDF format may have restrictions on commercial use. Review and comply with the applicable CIS license/terms before any commercial use.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** As of now, the tool only works for **Microsoft Windows configuration extracts**. Support for other platforms is planned in future updates.

## ‚ú® Features

- Accepts **CIS Benchmark files** in **PDF** or **XLSX** format.  
- Converts CIS Benchmark PDFs into structured XLSX files.  
- Parses machine extracts produced by [`audit-conf-extracts`](https://github.com/MatthisClavijo/audit-conf-extracts) (and can be extended with new parsers).  
- Compares extracted values with the benchmark requirements.  
- Outputs results in XLSX format showing machine values and compliance status.  
- Designed to be a **framework** where you can add your own parsers and converters.

## üöÄ Usage

### Command-line
After installation, use the CLI:

```bash
audit-conf-benchmarks --benchmark /path/to/CIS_Benchmark.pdf --workdir /path/to/extract_workdir
```

or with short options:

```bash
audit-conf-benchmarks -b benchmark.xlsx -w ./workdir
```

### Arguments
- `--benchmark, -b` ‚Üí Path to the benchmark file (PDF or XLSX).  
- `--workdir, -w` ‚Üí The directory containing extracted configuration files to audit.  

### Example
```bash
audit-conf-benchmarks -b CIS_Microsoft_Windows_10_Enterprise_Benchmark_v3.0.0.pdf -w ./DESKTOP-QUO897J/
```

## üìÇ Output

The tool generates an **XLSX report** that includes:

- Extracted values from the target system.  
- Relevant benchmark requirements.  
- Compliance status (compliant / non-compliant / check manually).  

---

## üõ† Extensibility

audit-conf-benchmarks is built as a **framework**:  

- **Parsers** ‚Üí Add support for new extract formats beyond `audit-conf-extracts`.  
- **Converters** ‚Üí Integrate support for different types of benchmarks or file formats besides CIS PDF.  

Contributions are welcome!
